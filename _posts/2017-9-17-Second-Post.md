title: Thoughts about Jekyll
---

So setting up a blog on GitHub Pages with Jekyll being used to generate the web pages was much easier than I anticipated. Though while I did use a [guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to get me through it, the learning process afterwards has been quite fun. 

Not only have I been using my miniscule CSS knowledge to make changes to the default theme that this blog came with, but also learning about Git and GitHub along the way as well. Being able to update your blog with just the pushing of a file is pretty cool I have to say.
