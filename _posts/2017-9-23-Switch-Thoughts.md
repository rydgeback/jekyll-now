title: A few moments with the Switch
---

I recently had the chance to try out a friend's Nintendo Switch. I've wanted one since the day it launched. I really find the emphasis on split-screen multiplayer to be refreshing in this online gaming age.

Being able to play split-screen even on the small handheld display is pretty cool. Mario Kart 8 looked great even on that, and so did Pokken Tournament. Honestly wasn't expecting the display and the graphics to be as good as they were. While it's nothing mind-blowing, it should be good enough for the majority.

Another pretty cool thing was the amount of usability present in a single controller (called Joy-Cons). In a pinch you can use a single Joy-Con as a controller, though it isn't the best for that application. You can use a Joy-Con in each hand, or even slot them together into a controller grip for home play, or into either side of the Switch unit for on-the-go gaming.

Nintendo really put in a lot of thought into the Switch and it shows. The elephant in the room is still 3rd party support, but as of the time of this post, a fair number of big studios have pledged support for the Switch, so things are looking bright.
