title: Some more thoughts on the Switch
---

Having had the Switch for about 6 months now, there is now more to talk about. Much of my initial thoughts remain unchanged, though now a more longer term perspective has developed.

It's hard to not feel that the console is a tad underpowered on the hardware front. In handheld mode this isn't much of an issue as the small screen size manages to cover up most visual blemishes. But blown up onto a big TV things are much more easier to spot. This isn't to detract from Nintendo's fantastic art direction in their games, with _Breath of the Wild_ being a gorgeous game despite the resolution it runs at in docked mode. Same goes for _Mario Kart 8_. A future hardware revision will do wonders, though it's early in the console's lifecycle for one.

On the software front, Nintendo hasn't been slacking, with OS updates every now and then, some even adding new features. What started off as an extremely solid, extremely lightweight OS purely for facilitating gameplay, has been slowly evolving. Certain "necessities" still remain absent such as a web browser, and a trophy system. But then again that is a matter of opinion
